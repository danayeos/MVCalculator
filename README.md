# MVC Calculator

## Description
This project is a simple calculator application built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division while demonstrating the principles of MVC architecture, proper separation of concerns, and interaction between the model, view, and controller.

## Features
- **Basic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Error Handling:** Properly handles division by zero and invalid input.
- **User Interface:** A simple and intuitive interface created using Swing (or JavaFX).
- **Real-time Results:** Displays results immediately upon button clicks.

## Architecture
The project is divided into three main components:
- **Model (CalculatorModel):** Contains the business logic and methods for arithmetic operations.
- **View (CalculatorView):** Responsible for the user interface, including input fields and result display.
- **Controller (CalculatorController):** Manages user input, interacts with the model, and updates the view.

## Requirements
- JDK 11 or higher
- Java Swing (or JavaFX)
